# Accessibility Monitoring for Your Website

AccessLint Monitor will alert you of accessibility errors in your website.

## Usage

Install AccessLint Monitor by including the javascript in at the end of any page
you want to monitor.

## How it works

AccessLint Monitor is similar to client side performance measurement tools like
NewRelic or Google Analytics in the way it is included and run on your website.
When a visitor arrives at a page that has the script installed, an audit will
run in the background automatically. If there are any accessibility issues on
that page, AccessLint Monitor track the error for review.
